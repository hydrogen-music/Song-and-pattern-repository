This repository contains free songs and patterns for the hydrogen drum machine. Feel free to add data by using a pull request or creating an issue or by sending them to our mailing list. Patterns and songs must be stored in an appropriate pattern style directory. File metadata (author, lisence, comments..) must be written in English. If the style directory does not exist yet, you can look at the id3 musical genres [1] or use a more drummer-oriented (and widely used) name and create the directory to put your file in.
