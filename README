This repository contains free songs and patterns for the hydrogen drum machine. Feel free to add data by using a pull request or creating an issue or by sending them to our mailing list. Patterns and songs must be stored in the appropriate directory. File metadata (author, license, comments..) must be written in English. If you want to publish single patterns, please export them as a h2pattern file (File->export pattern). Please set the name of the pattern and the category of the pattern (rightclick on pattern -> properties) before you add it to this repository. You can look at the id3 musical genres [1] for possible categories.
