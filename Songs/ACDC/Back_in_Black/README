Title: "Back in Black"
Artist: ACDC

The Ending of this song is a fadeout over last 6 bars.   Song ends where fade is happening. 

How to Use:
Just open the h2song file in hydrogen. Everything uses the default Drum kit.    
I figured keeping the default kit makes things easier for those 
wanting to try it. 



Feel free to use this anyway you like.
