Title: "Smells Like Teen Spirit"
Artist: Nirvana

Brought to you by DeepSix

Description:

First Song I created using Hydrogen.   Lot's of room for improvement I'm sure. 

I thought this would be an easy intro into using Hydrogen.   
But leave it to Dave Grohl to make slight changes in the beat all through. 


How to Use:
Just open the h2song file in hydrogen. Everything uses the default Drum kit.


Feel free to use this anyway you like.
