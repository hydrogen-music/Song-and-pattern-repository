Artist: ZZ Top

How to Use:
Just open the h2song file in hydrogen. Everything uses the default Drum kit.    
The default kit did not have the correct rimshot/stick noise for the opening patterns. 
Its close enough, but I figured keepingthe default kit makes things easier for those 
wanting to try it. 

Feel free to use this anyway you like.
